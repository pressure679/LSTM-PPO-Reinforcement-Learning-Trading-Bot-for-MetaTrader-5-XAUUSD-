# MT5 XAUUSD LSTM PPO Trading Bot

A MetaTrader 5 reinforcement learning trading bot for XAUUSD (Gold).

The bot combines an LSTM neural network for sequence learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn trading decisions directly from historical market data.

Unlike traditional bots that rely on fixed rules, the PPO agent learns when to Buy, Sell or Hold from thousands of market examples.

The program should be in a folder or the desktop where the 5m csv file with OHLC data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/novandraanugrah/xauusd-gold-price-historical-data-2004-2024 is, in training it will then make a LSTM-PPO-saves folder where the training is saved (used for making decisions, also in testing).

## Current Strategy

Current reward structure:

- Take Profit: 20 pips
- Stop Loss: 40 pips
- Risk/Reward: 1 : 0.5

The current focus is high-probability momentum trades rather than large swing trades.

## Training

The PPO agent trains continuously over historical MT5 data.

Example metrics during training:

- Win rate: 70–85%
- Profit Factor: 1.5–3+
- Weekly performance: typically 10–30R during training (varies by market conditions)

These figures are training statistics only and are not guarantees of future performance.

### Quarterly stats

## Weekly PPO Training Performance by Quarter

Training period: **~June 2024 – June 1, 2026** (102 rolling weekly training windows)

| Period | Approx. Dates          | Avg Weekly R | Avg PF | Avg Max DD | Avg Recovery Factor |
| ------ | ---------------------- | -----------: | -----: | ---------: | ------------------: |
| Q1     | Jun 2024 – Sep 2024    |        6.20R |   1.10 |      8.80R |                2.04 |
| Q2     | Sep 2024 – Dec 2024    |        7.39R |   1.12 |      9.80R |                2.25 |
| Q3     | Dec 2024 – Mar 2025    |       16.89R |   1.25 |      8.14R |                5.42 |
| Q4     | Mar 2025 – Jun 2025    |       43.73R |   1.29 |     10.81R |                9.20 |
| Q5     | Jun 2025 – Sep 2025    |       36.54R |   1.38 |      8.94R |                8.72 |
| Q6     | Sep 2025 – Dec 2025    |       75.07R |   1.38 |      8.62R |               19.42 |
| Q7     | Dec 2025 – Mar 2026    |      164.37R |   1.82 |      7.23R |               54.69 |
| Q8*    | Mar 2026 – Jun 1, 2026 |      126.55R |   1.49 |      8.76R |               34.54 |

*Q8 contains the final 11 weeks of training.

### Observations

* Profit Factor increased from approximately **1.10** during the earliest training period to **1.4–1.8** in the later periods.
* Average weekly drawdown remained relatively stable between **7R and 10R** despite substantially higher returns.
* Recovery Factor improved significantly over time, indicating that profitability increased faster than drawdown.
* The strongest performance occurred during the final two quarters while maintaining comparable risk characteristics.
