# MT5 XAUUSD LSTM PPO Trading Bot

A MetaTrader 5 reinforcement learning trading bot for XAUUSD (Gold).

The bot combines an LSTM neural network for sequence learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn trading decisions directly from historical market data.

Unlike traditional bots that rely on fixed rules, the PPO agent learns when to Buy, Sell or Hold from thousands of market examples.

## Current Strategy

Current reward structure:

- Take Profit: 20 pips
- Stop Loss: 40 pips
- Risk/Reward: 1 : 0.5

The current focus is high-probability momentum trades rather than large swing trades.

---

## Training

The PPO agent trains continuously over historical MT5 data.

Example metrics during training:

- Win rate: 70–85%
- Profit Factor: 1.5–3+
- Weekly performance: typically 10–30R during training (varies by market conditions)

These figures are training statistics only and are not guarantees of future performance.
